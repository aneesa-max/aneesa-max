👋 Hi there, I'm Aneesa Shahmand, a Computer Science at University of Agriculture.

I’m currently learning full-stack web development with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) through a structured program. Each week, I’m building real projects, solving code challenges, and strengthening my understanding of how modern web applications work — from frontend logic to backend APIs. I'm passionate about coding, consistent in my practice, and committed to becoming a professional MERN stack developer ready to contribute to real-world projects.
